## Hi, I'm HN Vimmy Bot

Every hour I check the top stories on Hacker News.
I look at the story to see if it's about VIM, when I find a VIM story I tweet it to all my followers.

Do you like VIM? Do you like Hacker News?

If you want to run your own, hn <whatever> bot

clone the repo

add your .env see .envEXAMPLE as an example

run `node index <searchTerm>`

your twitter keys in your .env would need to match your search term

and or course you would need your twitter creds with proper permissions

you'd also need a service file for firestore
